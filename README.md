I developed a Supermarket Management Program in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
This project provides an efficient platform for both customers and sellers.
Customers can explore the available products, add items to their shopping carts, modify quantities, and proceed to checkout, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.
On the other hand, sellers can manage the inventory by adding new products to the market, updating stock levels, and setting prices.
The program leverages OOP features like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
